# kubernetes-manifest-files


Here, I have uploaded some manifest files including:

1. Namespace files
2. Pod files
3. Replica files
4. Secret files
5. Service files
6. SSL key files
7. Volume files.

Please note that "manifest files" are configuration files that describe the desired state of Kubernetes objects, such as pods, services, deployments, and more. These files are written in YAML or JSON format and are used to deploy and manage containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

Manifest files specify details such as the container images to be used, the number of replicas to run, the desired state of the pod, the ports to expose, and other configuration parameters. Once the manifest files are created, they can be applied to a Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command.

Manifest files are YAML or JSON files that are used to define Kubernetes objects such as pods, deployments, services, and others. They are used to declare the desired state of the object, which is then used by Kubernetes to create and manage the object.

Here is a brief description of the manifest files you have uploaded:

1. Namespace files: These files define a Kubernetes namespace, which is a virtual cluster within a Kubernetes cluster. Namespaces can be used to isolate resources and provide better organization and management of Kubernetes objects.

2. Pod files: These files define a Kubernetes pod, which is the smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes. A pod contains one or more containers, which are deployed together on the same host and share the same network namespace.

3. Replica files: These files define a Kubernetes ReplicaSet, which is a higher-level abstraction that manages a set of pods. A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at any given time.

4. Secret files: These files define Kubernetes secrets, which are used to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other credentials. Secrets are stored in an encrypted format and can be accessed by pods and other Kubernetes objects.

5. Service files: These files define a Kubernetes service, which is an abstraction that enables network access to a set of pods. A service provides a stable IP address and DNS name that can be used to access the pods.

6. SSL key files: These files contain SSL/TLS certificates and keys that are used to secure network communication between pods and other Kubernetes objects.

7. Volume files: These files define Kubernetes volumes, which are used to store data that needs to persist beyond the lifetime of a pod. Volumes can be used to share data between containers in a pod or between pods in a cluster.
